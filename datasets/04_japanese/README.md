# Japanese dataset

According to the dataset description [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Japanese+Credit+Screening), the observations in the dataset _'represent positive and negative instances of people who were and were not granted credit.'_ 

Such a dataset would be useful for experiments on reject inference if only there was a target of actual defaults.

Since there is no information on defaults, I would suggest that we skipped the dataset in our experiment.
